# Xamt++: Adapter-Aware Cross-Framework API Differential Testing

Xamt++ is the release artifact for the current cross-framework API matching and
differential testing pipeline. It extends the original XAMT prototype from a
small set of framework shims to an adapter-aware matcher and runner covering
10 numerical and deep-learning libraries:

`chainer`, `jax`, `keras`, `mindspore`, `mxnet`, `numpy`, `paddle`, `scipy`,
`tensorflow`, and `torch`.

The artifact contains the code used to mine APIs, form cross-library
equivalence groups, validate those groups through adapters, fuzz the executable
groups, and replay the current differential bug reproductions.

The older `functions/`, `inputs/`, `run_tasks/`, `tests/`, and `utilities/`
directories are retained for compatibility with the original XAMT artifact.
The current Xamt++ pipeline is driven by `tools/` and `bug_repros/`.

## Current Coverage and Result Snapshot

Current artifact snapshot: `2026-05-25`.

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Libraries | 10 |
| Pairwise adapter-aware groups | 650 |
| Unique APIs in executable groups | 4372 |
| Raw mined APIs | 8782 |
| Static pairwise DIFF groups | 46 |
| Current unique DIFF candidates | 194 keys / 137 base groups |
| Recommended likely real bugs | 190 keys / 133 base groups |

The count definitions and evidence are recorded in
`PAIRWISE_ADAPTER_SUMMARY.md`, `ALL_BUG_CANDIDATES.md`,
`REAL_BUG_AUDIT.md`, and `bug_repros/README.md`.

## Environment Model

The full 10-library run uses one main Python process plus optional external
Python workers for libraries that conflict with the main environment.

Main process:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `torch`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `jax`

External workers:

- `XAMT_PADDLE_PY` for Paddle
- `XAMT_MINDSPORE_PY` for MindSpore
- `XAMT_CHAINER_PY` for Chainer
- `XAMT_MXNET_PY` for MXNet

If an external worker is not configured, the runner skips that library during
API collection or reports it as unavailable during execution. This lets partial
runs work in a single environment while keeping the full artifact reproducible
on a machine with all worker environments installed.

Observed local main environment:

```text
Python 3.13.5
numpy 2.2.6
scipy 1.16.3
torch 2.11.0+cu128
tensorflow 2.21.0
keras 3.14.0
jax 0.9.2
```

For a new machine, start with `requirements-main.txt`, then create external
worker environments for Paddle, MindSpore, Chainer, and MXNet as described in
`ARTIFACT.md`.

## Quick Start

Run the artifact sanity check. This does not import heavyweight DL libraries.

```bash
cd Xamt
python -B tools/artifact_check.py
```

Inspect matched API coverage from the recorded summary.

```bash
sed -n '1,35p' PAIRWISE_ADAPTER_SUMMARY.md
```

Replay one curated bug. The exact result depends on which libraries are
installed and which external worker variables are set.

```bash
python -B bug_repros/bug_001_clip_generic_3.py
```

Run the deterministic adapter-aware validation over mined APIs.

```bash
python -B -m tools.diff_static_candidate_groups \
  --strategy pairwise-adapter-aware \
  --details 20
```

Run a timed fuzzing pass over already matched groups.

```bash
python -B -m tools.timed_group_fuzz \
  --strategy pairwise-adapter-aware \
  --seconds-per-group 60 \
  --include-edge-values \
  --include-nonfinite \
  --stop-on-diff \
  --jsonl results/pairwise_edge_nonfinite.jsonl
```

Build a clean source artifact archive.

```bash
python -B tools/build_artifact.py --out dist/xamtplusplus-artifact.tar.gz
```

## How the Pipeline Works

1. `api_match_common.py` defines the target namespaces, alias rules, category
   terms, and parameter role normalization.
2. `compare_api_matchers.py` mines callables, records signatures/docs, groups
   APIs by canonical name/category/arity/roles, and assigns confidence scores.
3. `diff_static_candidate_groups.py` maps a group to executable inputs through
   per-library adapters, normalizes outputs, and labels the group as `PASS`,
   `DIFF`, `ERROR`, or `SKIP`.
4. The `pairwise-adapter-aware` strategy validates executable pair matches and
   unions passing pairs into connected API components.
5. `timed_group_fuzz.py` refreshes canonical inputs with random, edge-value,
   and nonfinite states, then repeatedly executes each group within a time
   budget.
6. `bug_repros/` replays curated candidates against the current runner and
   counts only live `status: DIFF` outputs as reproducible bugs.

## Reporting Counts

Use the following default language when reporting this artifact:

> Xamt++ covers 10 libraries, 650 adapter-aware API groups, and 4372 APIs in
> executable matched groups. The current candidate table contains 194 unique
> DIFF keys across 137 base API groups. After manual false-positive audit, the
> recommended count is 190 likely real differential bugs across 133 base
> groups; a stricter reportable count is 188 bugs across 131 base groups.
